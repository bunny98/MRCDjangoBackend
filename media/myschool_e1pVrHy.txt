The school is such a sweet heaven on earth that prepares the small minds for great tasks. The school provides education to live better and make progress for tomorrow. Not only it provides education but it is a tool of character building of a nation. The good schools are true assets of a nation. I am blessed to study in such a great school. My school is the best school in our entire city.
I study in one of the best school of our city. My school name is (write name of your school).  My school has a great history of serving my country. My school has produced many great people for my country. It has a big and beautiful building that looks shiny from far away.
I reach at my at the fixed timing. I come to school with other friends of mine. We happily enter into the schools with great confidence. We take part in school assembly and then we move into our classrooms.  As I enter into my classroom I find quite relaxed.
